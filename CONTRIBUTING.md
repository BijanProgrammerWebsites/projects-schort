# Contributing to Schort

First of all, thank you for the time that you are gifting us.
Any contribution will be happily received and appreciated.

In order to maintain consistency among codes, there are a few points you need to consider which we will discuss in the following document.

## Search Created Issues

There may be issues similar to what you have in mind;
So please take a look at open issues first.

Also, we would be glad if you take a shot at solving old issues.

## Create an Issue

If you don't find an issue similar to your bug or requested feather, then you are more than welcome to create a new one.

Before taking any action such as forking the project or creating a pull request,
please first create an issue in the project's GitHub page.

We would like to expand the project and add new features to it, but we don't think that this project is meant to solve every possible problem.
The project's goal has been determined at the beginning of the development process, and features that don't help us reach that goal won't be accepted.

## Wait for Confirmation

After you found or created your issue, please wait for one of the developers to confirm the issue.
If a developer checks it and doesn't confirm it, they might close it after giving a reason to do so.

To prevent wasting your time, please do not proceed any further if the issue has not been checked by a developer yet.

## Fork The Project

After a developer confirms the issues, please fork the project and start the development process.

## Clean Code

We do care about keeping our code clean, and we ask you to do as well.
In order to make it easier for the developer to find the issues,
we use Prettier, ESLint and any other tool that is needed.
Please integrate your text editor or IDE to use these tools while developing.

## Create a Pull Request

After solving the issue, please create a new pull request.
Address the issue in the description of the pull request.

A developer will review it as soon as possible.
Please cooperate with the developer and take the actions that are needed.

If the developer approves your pull request, they will merge it and close the issue as well.
